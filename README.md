## Hi there 👋 I’m Samuel Olayenikan

I’m a Product Manager at Cavista Technologies with over five years of experience launching digital products that improve user experience and business efficiency. I enjoy connecting strategy, design, and technology to bring ideas from concept to market.

I’m currently expanding my skill set into full-stack development, building hands-on projects to deepen my technical understanding and become a more well-rounded product leader. My goal is to blend product thinking with engineering insight to build solutions that truly scale.
